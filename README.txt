|                  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:                        |

|       AML requires Java SE Runtime Environment 7.            |
|         It will not run on older Java versions.              |
|    Memory usage depends on the size of the ontologies you    |
|   are working with. We recommend a minimum of 2 GB RAM for   |
|   small ontologies (<1,000 classes), 4 GB RAM for medium-    |
|   sized ontologies (<10,000 classes), 8 GB RAM for large     |
|   ontologies (<100,000 classes), and 16 GB RAM for larger    |
|   ontologies.                                                |
|   We also recommend restarting AML when changing from one    |
|   pair of ontologies to another, to avoid memory usage       |
|   build up.                                                  |
|  Please keep in mind that opening large ontologies may take  |
|   several minutes. Likewise, matching large ontologies may   |
|   also take several minutes, particularly when WordNet or    |
|  large ontologies are used as background knowledge sources   |
|          and/or the repair option is selected.               |

|   AML is a lightweight automated ontology matching system    |
|   specialized on biomedical ontologies but applicable to     |
|   other domains. It is described in:                         |

|   AgreementMakerLight Results for OAEI 2013, ISWC Workshop   |
|   on Ontology Matching, 2013.                                |

|  The AML GUI uses Gephi, an open source graph visualization  |
|  and manipulation software. Like AML, Gephi is lightweight   |
|  and efficient. However, it has its faults and limitations,  |
|  which have an impact on the AML GUI. Namely, the rendered   |
|  graph will only ajust to the size of the "Mapping View"     |
|   panel upon being clicked, an inconvenience for which we    |
|                        apologize.                            |
